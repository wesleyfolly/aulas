# ComfyUI - Automações com imagens e vídeos

[Ohneis on Instagram: "Most AI workflows are lazy. That’s why your results still look flat, like filters pasted over stock photos. The easy path — drag-and-drop apps, one-click presets — will always leave you stuck at “almost good enough.”  The fix? A node-based system. Not the fast route, but the powerful one. With ComfyUI you can run Stable Diffusion locally, right on your own machine. No hidden presets, no gatekeeping, no limits. At first it feels complex. But once you learn the flow, you’re free. Full control over every step of the pipeline.  Here’s where the magic happens: 👉 Start with Stable Diffusion as the base model. 👉 Add a LoRA — a lightweight add-on that locks a style. That’s how you force a Wes Anderson vibe: pastel tones, symmetry, cinematic frames. 👉 Feed it into Nano Banana to alternate angles like a real set. 👉 Push the sequence into Wan for animation, so it feels like cinema. 👉 Finish with Topaz Video Upscaler for sharp, production-grade detail.  The result isn’t just “an AI image.” It’s a system where every node is a decision. Every branch is intentional. You’re not just prompting, you’re directing. That’s the difference between playing with AI and producing with AI.  And this is the real shift most people miss: prompts alone won’t save you. Without a system, you’ll keep guessing forever. With a node-based workflow, you start building like a studio — consistent, scalable, and repeatable.
